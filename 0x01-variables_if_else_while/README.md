# Tasks
## 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing.
* This C program will assign a random number to the variable n
each time it is executed.
* It make use of the srand() and rand() funtions to generate
a new random each time it is run.
* If the random numer is positive, the program will print
the number and say _is positive_.
* If the number is negative it say _is negative_.
## 1. The last digit.
* A program will assign a random number to the variable
n each time it is executed.
* It uses the rand, srand, and RAND_MAX to generate a random each
time the program execute.

if:
	* _The last digit is greater than 5.
	* _is equal to 0_.
	* _is less than 6 and not 0_.
